# William Lucht's Flexbox Portfolio

## Description
The motivation for this project was to utilize the 'flexbox' positioning alongside media queries inside our CSS. I decided to build a portfolio using these techniques because the landing page had manageable User Stories to navigate a basic portfolio page. I learned quite a but about HTML child and ancestor relationships while working on the flexbox layout.
